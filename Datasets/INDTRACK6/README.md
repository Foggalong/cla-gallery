# `INDTRACK6`

Based on a timeseries of weekly S&P 500 asset prices, from 1991-03 to 1997-09, split into 291 time steps. Exact time steps are unknown and asset labels have been anonymised. Note that the computed `return.csv` and `risk.csv` explicitly only do this for the 457 composite assets, excluding the prices of the overall index.
